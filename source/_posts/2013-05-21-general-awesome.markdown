Lots been going on lately.  Started as dev in residence at general assembly for a friend end class. Very humbling.  I'm not very great with this responsive design and and awesome css tricks.  Here's a few things I've taken note of thus far.

clearfix is a really neat way to get divs to actually contain other divs.  normalize.css is awesome and gives you some clearfix classes you may use to apply to divs. @media allows you to watch the screen size and show different screen sizes. below are the codes used to add your own styles between the { }

    If the device supports media queries...
    @media only screen {}

    and it is at least 768 px...
    @media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {}

    @media only screen and (min-width: 1280px) {}

    @media only screen and (min-width: 1440px) {}

    @media only screen and (min-width: landscape) {}

    @media only screen and (min-width: portrait) {}

python is nifty and ive really been enjoying the notebook.  the following command gets it up and running after an easy_install and/or pip_install of the notebook and pylab dependencies.


   ipython --pylab notebook

I've been using nodejs a bit lately, and all the things I dislike about it seem to be alleviated in this nice language invented by these fellows at google.  I'm thinking go is a better bet for a scalable system that is maintainable.  The argument that context switching is annoying doesnt hold water when weighed against performance issues.  Maybe I need some citations?  Maybe not.

foundation.css is awesome. the 12 column layout concept is really novel.

Some cool sites ive read lately and found awesome for various reasons.
