Inspired by Joel on Software I'd like to make my own little software test...
Ten items.  8 or better is acceptable.  Below 8 and reevaluate.

    The Josh Test (Don't josh me)

    Do you use source control?
    Can you make a build in one step?
    Do you make daily builds?
    Do you have a bug database?
    Do you write tests for bugs before you fix them?
    Are you using a kanban system to do work in the form of tickets?
    Do you write tests for new tickets?
    Do programmers have quiet working conditions?
    Do you use the best tools money can buy?
    Do new candidates write code during their interview?


Some additional ones that are more preferential and rightfully punish you for not having the prerequisite version control system....

Does your process of using a version control system reference your tickets?
Can you tie the work for a desired feature to actual commits in a VCS?
