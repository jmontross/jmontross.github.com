"Algorithms are the most important and durable part of computer science because
they can be studied in a language- and machine-independent way"

"It is traditional for the author to magnanimously accept the blame for whatever
deﬁciencies remain. I don’t. Any errors, deﬁciencies, or problems in this book are
somebody else’s fault, but I would appreciate knowing about them so as to determine who is to blame."

These quotes come from the Algorithm Design Manual.  I just began reading it at the recommendation of a trusted and wise Sherif of the devbootcamp in San Francisco.  Best, Worst, and Average-Case Complexity => these are the ideas that the book describes nicely using graphs.  I'd like to get some pretty graphs of my three solutions to the unsorted array and integer x problem, and I need a nice way to make graphs on an X/Y plane in ruby... I'm thinking I'll just use a js library
